# Welcome to 2D_3D_CV!
### Firstly, what is this about? 
This study looked at different CNN architectures. Specifically, I developed two experiments in parallel of 3x CNN models to compare 2D vs 3D performance metrics when diagnosing/classifying chest CT scans. 

### The contents include: 
- **Python Scripts & Notebook**: Python scripts & notebooks!
  - **2D Models**: python scripts showing 3x 2D CNN designs.
  - **3D Models**: python scripts of 3x 3D CNN models - these are the 3D equivalents of the above 2D models.
  - **MosMedCT_EDA.ipynb**: Exploratory analysis and pre-processing of this CT dataset.
  - **Run_Models.ipynb**: Sagemaker notebook to deploy all these models in an EC2 instance in AWS.
- **README.md**: Hello, you're reading me.
- **Report.pdf**: An academic-style report explaining the motivation of the study and reporting the results (spoiler alert, 3D wins, but the final outcome may still surprise you!).
